## Description of the project
The goal of this project is to develop a real estate web application that provides numerous functionalities for different types of users. This project aims to provide said functionalities to the following 4 user types:

* Home-buyers 
* Property renters
* Brokers
* System administrators

Home-buyers and property renters are able to search for a property to buy or rent using various attributes as filters. They are also able to search for brokers, and home buyers will be able to consult a mortgage calculator for a specific property. Brokers will be able to manage their clients which are the home-buyers and property renters. The brokers will also be able to view the numerous offers of their clients and manage them. Finally, the administrators will be able to manage the brokers. This web application's design will be simple and effective to allow the different types of users to easily interact with each other.

## Built with
This project has been developed using the MERN stack. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
Companies are looking for experienced developers who have can work with these popular frameworks, and so it is a good idea to start learning them as soon as possible.

This technology stack allows us to make a modern real estate application with fully functional features. MongoDB efficiently manages our real estate data base; we will be using the mongoose library as it faciliates our job. Express.js faciliates server-side connections. React, Vite and React Router create an intuitive, fast and responsive frontend. Node.js ensures optimal performance with the ability to use javascript in the backend. Bootstrap is a library that complements our user Interface.

We could have decided to use basic HTML/CSS/Js; however, these tools are outdated and would not be suited for our modern application.
